# mtm6201-midterm
This is the midterm, where I need to create a three page website using HTML and CSS.

Design inspired and based off of this one:
https://www.figma.com/community/file/893381127703378146
Which was created by this person:
https://www.figma.com/@marvisighedosa

Original image assets also came from the above contributer.

This site was coded by Robert Liam Ryan.
They will do better.

They will try this idea again in the summer, to practice.
They will learn.
